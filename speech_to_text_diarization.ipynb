        "# Audio Diarization with OpenAI's `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize`\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to perform audio diarization using OpenAI's `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize` model. It takes an audio file as input, processes it in chunks, and generates a diarized transcript, identifying different speakers in the audio.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Audio Diarization:** Identifies and separates speakers in an audio file.\n",
        "*   **Chunking:** Processes large audio files by splitting them into smaller chunks to meet API limits.\n",
        "*   **Retry Mechanism:** Includes a retry logic for API calls to handle transient errors.\n",
        "*   **Speaker Recognition (Optional):** Supports providing known speaker references for improved diarization.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **OpenAI API Key:**\n",
        "    *   Obtain an OpenAI API key from the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/).\n",
        "    *   In Google Colab, go to the \"🔑\" (Secrets) icon on the left panel.\n",
        "    *   Add a new secret named `OPENAI_API_KEY` and paste your OpenAI API key as the value.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Install Dependencies:**\n",
        "    The notebook automatically installs the required Python packages (`openai`, `pydub`) and `ffmpeg`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Upload Audio File:**\n",
        "    *   Upload your audio file (e.g., `audio.wav`, `meeting.mp3`) to the Colab environment. You can drag and drop it into the file browser on the left panel or use the code cells to upload.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Configure Input File:**\n",
        "    *   Modify the `input_file` variable in the code to point to your uploaded audio file.\n",
        "    *   _Optional:_ If you have a reference audio file for a known speaker, upload it and update `known_speaker_ref_file` and `known_speaker_name` accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Run All Cells:**\n",
        "    *   Execute all cells in the notebook. The script will process the audio, perform diarization, and save the transcript to a text file (e.g., `audio_diarized_output.txt`).\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **View Output:**\n",
        "    *   The diarized transcript will be saved in the same directory as a `.txt` file, which you can then download or view directly in Colab.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Output Format\n",
        "\n",
        "The output file will contain lines in the format:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "[start_time-end_time] Speaker_Identifier: Transcribed Text\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "[0.00-2.50] Speaker 1: Hello, how are you today?\n",
        "[2.50-5.10] Speaker 2: I'm doing great, thanks for asking!\n",
        "```\n",

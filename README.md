[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kurtvalcorza/notebooks/blob/main/Transcribe_Audio_Whisper.ipynb)

This notebook demonstrates how to transcribe audio files using OpenAI’s Whisper model via the whisper Python package. It supports common audio formats (e.g., MP3, WAV) and provides a simple pipeline for uploading, transcribing, and saving transcripts.

# Audio Diarization with `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize`

This notebook demonstrates how to perform audio diarization using OpenAI's `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize` model. It takes an audio file as input, processes it in chunks, and generates a diarized transcript, identifying different speakers in the audio. Obtain an OpenAI API key from the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/).

# H2O Flow in Google Colab
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kurtvalcorza/notebooks/blob/main/H2O_Flow_Google_Colab.ipynb)

This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to setting up and accessing H2O Flow within a Google Colab environment. It installs necessary dependencies, initializes the H2O server, and uses localtunnel to create a public URL for the H2O Flow web interface, allowing users to interact with H2O's machine learning capabilities directly from Colab.
